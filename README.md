# Fun Python Projects

This is a personal collection of projects made with Python. My intention is to explore any interesting ideas and libraries I find while learning more about Python and computer science in general. Don't expect the code to be very efficient or beautifully written, but feel free to take anything you like.

# Resources

These are some of the resources I use when looking for inspiration. All the projects made by following a tutorial or blog post will cite the corresponding resources.
