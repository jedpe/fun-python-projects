# Cryptography Ciphers

These are basic implementations of some cipher algorithms with separate functions for encryption and decryption. Of course, these implementations are not secure in any way and should not be used. I will keep adding algorithms as I learn about them. These are some of the ciphers I have implemented or that I am planning to implement:

- [x] Caesar Cipher
- [ ] Vigen√®re Cipher
- [ ] Hill Cipher
- [ ] Playfair Cipher
